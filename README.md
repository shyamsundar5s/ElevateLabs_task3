# ElevateLabs_task3
This project focuses on predicting **house prices** using a **Linear Regression** model. It leverages features like **lot area**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms** to estimate property value. The data comes from the popular [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition on Kaggle.

Key highlights of the project:
* 🛠️ **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and performed feature selection
* 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered relationships between features and price
* 🧠 **Model Building**: Trained and tested a regression model using `scikit-learn`
* 📊 **Result Interpretation**: Visualized prediction accuracy and model residuals
